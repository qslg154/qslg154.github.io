Hi, I am a secondary school student from Hong Kong that is interested in _way_ too many fields, including but not limited to:

- Contract bridge
- Drawing
- Playing instruments (I am learning to play Dizi!)g
- Programming
- Reading
- Learning languages (日本語勉強中)
- And finally, Mathematics

However, I don't really have much success in all the fields I mentioned, to the point that I can't even say I am a "Jack of all trades" as Jack at least worth 1 HCP (high card point) but I don't. 

I am particularly interested in mathematics though, but it is _really really_ difficult, and burnouts can be really frequent at some times.

I have bad literacy skill to the point that I can't even write fluent sentence in my Chinese writing. Yes my Chinese sucks but I think Chinese is just a much more beautiful language than English. For example, 文言文 can encapsulate a lot of details in one sentence so poets/writers can be very creative for their writings. Though English is still more convinient and global in real life. I have been trying to pick up my Chinese skill by reading novels.

Outside of all of that, I am also a _touhou_ fan, though more on the music
than the actual 'Gensoukyo'. Nonetheless, getting to know touhou did changed my life by a lot. I have quite a lot of merchanise of the series tho. (inc. ふもふも！, they are so cute!)
